STEPS FOR THE ML
1)Crop images from 2448x2448 --> 2304x2304
	Now 2304/256, by doing that we divide the images in 9x9 (81)
	small pieces. The input of U-net would be (81, 256, 256, 3) for
	each image. 81 because now each image is divided in 81 smaller ones,
	256 height, 256 width and 3 because of the RGB of each pixel.

2)Convert into numpy array (no need for one hot encoding)

3)Prepare Y training:
	Same crop and patches (9x9) but we need to do one hot encoding.
	(81, 256, 256, num_classes).
